# Professor: Steve Alberts
# Course: 
- Pass Fail
- Grade: Pass with an A
- Overall experience: Great class. Professor Alberts will really pull the best out of you, and he will not be afraid to call you out on your mistakes and tell you where you can be better. The reading for this class was very engaging, and he provided 3 weeks for the final presentation. Follow his directions and you will do great.
